# ComputationalPathologyTask
A branch of pathology that involves computational analysis of a broad array of methods to analyse patient specimens for the study of disease. It is the analysis of digitized pathology images with associated metadata, typically using artificial intelligence (AI) methods. It is simply the use of computer algorithms for understanding disease.

## 1. Tissue fixation
Slide preparation begins with the fixation of your tissue specimen. This is a crucial step in tissue preparation, and its purpose is to prevent tissue autolysis and putrefaction

## 2. Specimen Transfer to Cassettes
After fixation, specimens are trimmed using a scalpel to enable them to fit into an appropriately labelled tissue cassette. Specimens should not be so big that they fill the cassette – they are trimmed so as not to touch the edges. Additionally, they must not be too thick 

## 3. Tissue Processing
Processing tissues into thin microscopic sections is usually done using a paraffin block, as follows:
1.	Dehydration, which involves immersing your specimen in increasing concentrations of alcohol to remove the water and formalin from the tissue.
2.	Clearing, in which an organic solvent such as xylene is used to remove the alcohol and allow infiltration with paraffin wax.
3.	Embedding, where specimens are infiltrated with the embedding agent – usually paraffin wax. The tissue becomes surrounded by a large block of molten paraffin wax, creating what is now referred to as the “block”.  Once the block solidifies, it provides a support matrix that allows very thin sectioning.

## 4. Staining
Most cells are transparent and appear almost colourless when unstained. Histochemical stains (typically hematoxylin and eosin) are therefore used to provide contrast to tissue sections, making tissue structures more visible and easier to evaluate.  Following staining, a coverslip is mounted over the tissue specimen on the slide, using optical grade glue, to help protect the specimen.

# Whole Slide Imaging
Whole slide imaging, also known as virtual microscopy, refers to scanning a complete microscope slide and creating a single high-resolution digital file. This is commonly achieved by capturing many small high-resolution image tiles or strips and then montaging them to create a full image of a histological section. It is basically scanning of conventional glass slides in order to produce digital slides.
# Magnification
Magnification is a change in the apparent size of an object, performed so that the object can more easily be seen. In traditional light microscopes used for pathology, a wide range of magnifications are available to ensure that the image observed through the oculars is large enough for easy viewing. The field of view is the area seen through the magnifier. As power increases, lens diameter and field of view decrease.

## 5x
A scanning objective lens provides the lowest magnification power of all objective lenses. 5x is a common magnification for scanning objectives and, when combined with the magnification power of a 10x eyepiece lens, a 5x scanning objective lens gives a total magnification of 50x. The name “scanning” objective lens comes from the fact that they provide observers with about enough magnification for a good overview of the slide. At 5 power (5X), field of view is about 1.5
## 10x
The low power objective lens has more magnification power than the scanning objective lens, and it is one of the most helpful lenses when it comes to observing and analysing glass slide samples. The total magnification of a low power objective lens combined with a 10x eyepiece lens is 100x magnification and it’s field view is about 0.5.
## 20x :
While looking at insects and most plant biology, a 10x or 20x objective is probably the right choice.
## 40x
The high-powered objective lens (also called “high dry” lens) is ideal for observing fine details within a specimen sample. The total magnification of a high-power objective lens combined with a 10x eyepiece is equal to 400x magnification,
